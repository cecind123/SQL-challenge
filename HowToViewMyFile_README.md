Hello! In the event that my Jupyter Lab file does not properly load in Github, please use this direct link to view my file. 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cecind123/SQL-challenge/blob/master/SQLHW.ipynb

Also, if you are individually importing in the CSVs, please disregard the block of code at the bottom of my SQL_table_schemata.sql file. The file path is for my computer, so please change accordingly.

Thanks!
